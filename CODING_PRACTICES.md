# Coding Practices

This is the fork-maintained coding policy template. Review and copy it into consuming projects separately from skills updates; project-specific constraints belong in each project AGENTS.md.


## Project-Specific Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State material assumptions explicitly; ask when missing information affects correctness or scope.
- For low-impact reversible choices, follow existing conventions and state the assumption.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- Pause dependent work only for critical ambiguity; continue independent work.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Coding Practices

### Code Organization

- **Single responsibility**: Each source file should have a clear, focused scope/purpose
- **Split large files**: Break files when they become large or handle too many concerns
- **Type separation**: Follow existing conventions; extract types only when actual reuse or complexity justifies it. Avoid over-abstraction for single-use code
- **Constants extraction**: Follow existing conventions; keep single-use constants local unless complexity justifies separation

### Runtime Environment

- **Prefer isomorphic code**: Write runtime-agnostic code that works in Node, browser, and workers whenever possible
- **Clear runtime indicators**: When code is environment-specific, add a comment at the top of the file:

```ts
// @env node
// @env browser
```

### TypeScript

- **Explicit return types**: Declare return types explicitly when possible
- **Avoid complex inline types**: Extract complex types into dedicated `type` or `interface` declarations

### Comments

- **Required comments**: All code must have comments; maintain corresponding comments for all code additions and modifications
- **Current behavior and intent**: Describe current behavior, business intent, or constraints, without refactoring-process commentary
